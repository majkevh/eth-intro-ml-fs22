# Introduction to Machine Learning

This repository houses the source code for the four coding assignments of  the course "Introduction to Machine Learning," conducted in the spring semester of 2022.

The repository is organized into five folders, each dedicated to one of the projects. The first project is further divided into two sub-projects. Within each folder, you will find a detailed task description along with the solutions developed by my teammate and me, implemented in Python.
